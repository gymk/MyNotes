# Art of Concurrency in Go

- 3 Objectives
  - Get you try Go
  - Feel on working with language
    - Syntax and Idioms
    - How to change my thinking
    - How to solve problem using this language
  - Give starting point
    - Materials/..
- Popular editors
  - VS Code
  - Goland

- Go good at Network Programming
  - STD library provides tooling/abstraction on that
    - `net` package in Go standard library
- Sample code available in
  - <https://github.com/jboursiquot/portscan>
- Go Source
  - <github.com/go>
    - Can see Go’s full source
- To know about a package
  - “pkg.go.dev”
    - You can search the package
- No Public/Private
  - Instead exported/non-exported
- Only ‘for’ loop
  - No `while`, `do … while`
- Go scheduler
  - Normally it will have multiple OS threads
  - Multiplexes the Go routines on one OS thread
  - This determines when a thread runs/ gets paused/ …
  - It is efficient, doesn’t impact OS threads
- `init` functions
  - Init functions of all the imported packages will get executed before `main` function
- No exception handling in Go
  - No Try/Catch
  - You handle error just like any other value
  - This enables logging/sending the errors to other outside world
- `maps` in Go is not concurrent
  - Package will tell whether it is concurrent support or not
- Communication between `Go` routines is using ‘chan’
  - Pipe/Buffered channel
